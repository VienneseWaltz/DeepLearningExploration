# DeepLearningExploration
Project to explore Deep Learning

This project introduces one to: 

1) Linear regression
2) The perceptron
3) Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
4) Training an ANN
5) Neural Network Architecture
6) Training a Neural Network


The RootCauseAnalysis.ipynb preprocesses a RCA data file, builds the RCA model,
And predicts the root causes with deep learning
